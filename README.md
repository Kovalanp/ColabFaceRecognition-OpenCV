# ðŸ˜± OpenCV Face Recognition For Colab ðŸ˜±
This repo is meant for those who prefer to use Google Colab for programming and AI development. Follow the instruction below to get up and running.

Just a heads up, if you find the following instructions confusing, you may want to check out my YouTube tutorial on the topic at: https://youtube.com/shorts/0nmR1mG7iu4.

**Step 1 - Getting Files:** Create a new Colab file and Copy + Paste the command below in the first cell (Don't forget to run it using Shift + Enter):

```!git clone https://github.com/virajdas/ColabFaceRecognition-OpenCV/```

**Step 2 - Getting Code:** Double click on the *OpenCVFaceRecognition.ipynb* file and when the popup open on the right side of the screen, Copy + Paste the code into a new code cell and *remove* the first 2 lines that read:
```
Code cell <0ic-jasPVq4d>
#%% [code]
```
Run it with Shift + Enter.

If you see a picture of Dwayne Johnson with the AI detecting his face you may move on.

**Step 3 - Adding Custom Image (Optional):** Remove the existing *me.jpg* file within the *ColabFaceRecognition-OpenCV* folder and take a picture of yourself or another person, name it: *me.jpg*, and upload it under the same folder as the old *me.jpg*.

**Step 4 - Congrats:** It's the moment of truth, run the code by clicking Shift + Enter.

Hopefully you now have a working AI face recognition script in Google Colab! ðŸ˜‰
